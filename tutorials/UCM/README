This tutorial was prepared to illustrate the new stabilization approach for viscoelastic constitutive models proposed in:

Improvements in the OpenFOAM numerical code for simulation of
steady-state differential viscoelastic flows, 11th OpenFOAM Workshop

and

De Araujo, M.S.B., Ferras, L.L.,Fernandes, C.,Nobrega, J.M.,
Improvements ans assessment of the integral viscoelastic solver in OpenFOAM, 11th OpenFOAM Workshop
Guimarães, Portugal, June 26 - 30, 2016


It comprises 2 case studies for the flow in a 4:1 abrupt contraction of an UCM viscoelastic fluid, for De=1

- UCM_Orig - employs the original formulation that diverges before reaching the endtime

- UCM_Stab - employs the new stabilized formulation that allows to achieve convergence for all time steps

######
Notes
######
(1) To use the new stabilized formulation the value of etaStab should be provided in "constant/viscoelasticProperties". If ommited the solver uses the original formulation

(2) Based on several studies performed, the value of etaStab should be similar to etaP
